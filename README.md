# Partial Zeroth-Order based Bilevel Optimizers
Implementations of the algorithms described in the paper [**On the Convergence Theory for Hessian-Free Bilevel Algorithms**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.07004). 

This repository is built on [hypertorch](https://github.com/prolearner/hypertorch). 
You can get started with the simple examples in IPython notebooks HyperRepresentation.ipynb and DeepHyperRepresentation.ipynb. 

This repo is under construction.
